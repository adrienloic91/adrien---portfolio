Welcome to my Python projects! Below are the projects I’ve completed so far:

A Python program that formats arithmetic problems vertically and optionally displays the results.

### 2. Time Calculator

A Python program that calculates the new time after adding a duration to a start time.  
It also calculates the resulting day of the week and how many days later it will be.
